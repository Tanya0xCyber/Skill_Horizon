# Domain Information Gathering 

**Objecive:**
This step collects fundamental domain and DNS information of the target. By gathering registrar details, DNS records, and IP addresses using whois, dig & nslookup , we create a foundational understanding of how the domain is hosted, its mail setup, and its network footprint.

## 1..**WHOIS**

**Purpose:**
Retrieves the domain registration details such as registrar, creation/expiry date, owner contact info, and name servers.

**Command used:**
```bash
whois yahoo.com > whois.txt
```

**Output file:**
[whois.txt](https://github.com/Tanya0xCyber/Skill_Horizon_Internship/blob/main/Passive-Footprinting-And-Reconn/Outputs/whois.txt)– contains all the WHOIS information for `yahoo.com`.

</p>

**Notes**
 * Domain registered by Yahoo Assets LLC (US) using MarkMonitor.
 * First registered on 1995-01-18, last updated on 2024-12-18.
 * Domain security protections are enabled (transfer/update/delete prohibited).
 * DNS hosted on ns1-5.yahoo.com.
 * DNSSEC not enabled, which could be considered a small security gap.

## 2..**DIG**

**Purpose:**
Queries the DNS records of `yahoo.com`, including A, MX, NS, TXT, and other records. Gives a snapshot of how the domain is configured.

**Command used:**
```bash
dig yahoo.com ANY @8.8.8.8 > dig.txt
```

**Output file:**
[dig.txt](https://github.com/Tanya0xCyber/Skill_Horizon_Internship/blob/main/Passive-Footprinting-And-Reconn/Outputs/dig.txt) – contains summarized DNS records.

</p>

**Notes**
 * Yahoo has many name servers → means high reliability.
 * We got IP addresses (A + AAAA records) → tells where yahoo.com is hosted.
 * We found mail servers (MX) → shows how Yahoo handles email.
 * TXT records → have security settings (SPF, Google/Facebook verification).
 * CAA records → only certain companies can give SSL certificates (secure).

## 3.**NSLOOKUP**

**Purpose:**
Finds the IP address of the domain and the DNS server being used. Useful to verify how the domain resolves to an IP.

**Command used :**
```bash
nslookup yahoo.com > nslookup.txt
```

**Output file:**
 [nslookup.txt](https://github.com/Tanya0xCyber/Skill_Horizon_Internship/blob/main/Passive-Footprinting-And-Reconn/Outputs/dig.txt)contains the IP address and DNS server info for `yahoo.com`.

</p>

**Notes:**
 * Server: 192.168.153.2 → This is the DNS server your system asked for info.
 * Non-authoritative answer: Data came from a cache, not directly from Yahoo’s main DNS.   
   Addresses:
     * IPv4: (74.6.231.21, 74.6.143.25, etc.) → These are Yahoo’s public IPs.
     * IPv6: (2001:4998:...) → Same but for IPv6 network.
