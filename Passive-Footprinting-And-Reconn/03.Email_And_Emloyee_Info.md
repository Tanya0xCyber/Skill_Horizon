#  3: Email & Employee Information Gathering (theHarvester)

### Objective :
The goal of this step is to gather publicly available **emails, employee names, and related hosts** for the target domain.  
This information can be useful in:
- **Social engineering attacks** (like phishing)
- **Username format discovery** (for brute-force attacks)
- **OSINT investigations** (knowing who works at the company)

###  Command Used

```bash
theHarvester -d yahoo.com -l 100 -b bing,duckduckgo,yahoo,linkedin > heharvester_yahoo.txt
````

* `-d yahoo.com` → target domain
* `-l 100` → limit to the first 100 results from each source
* `-b` → sources to use (bing, duckduckgo, yahoo, crtsh, linkedin)
* `> outputs/theharvester_yahoo.txt` → saves output to a text file for later review

### Output: 
[theharvester_yahoo.txt](https://github.com/Tanya0xCyber/Skill_Horizon_Internship/blob/main/Passive-Footprinting-And-Reconn/Outputs/theharvester_yahoo.txt)

**No emails, names, or hosts were found for yahoo.com.**
This is common for large companies because they usually implement measures to prevent employee data from being exposed online.

* No publicly available employee emails were found.
* This reduces the risk of phishing attacks against the organization.
* Even "no result" is a valuable finding — it shows good security posture.
